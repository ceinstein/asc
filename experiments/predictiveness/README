This experiment contains a bash script to run the experiment

---------RUNEXPER.SH-------- (for ubasic) ---------RUNEXPERC.SH---------(for c) 
Takes a filename (do not include .txt) and the rsaexecutable name as arguments (in that order)
    
    This script runs the asc system on the rsa file with the breakpoints in the
rsa_basic_loop_pcs.txt. This file contains the pcs in rsa that occur with the same
frequency as the program loops. This script will output a data file with the PCs and the
predictiveness of that PC for a given function. This script will also plot a histogram of
PCs vs the predictiveness that the PC yields

Both the ubasic version and the c version work and are run in the same way, but each need to read
different PC values.

EXAMPLE RUN

./runexper.sh filename rsafilename

executable files are assumed to be in the ubasicexper/experiments/executables folder.
The asc folder is assumed to be immediately outside the /ubasicexper folder
The naming convention is execname* where * = the prime number.

COMMON ERRORS

Dividing by zero

	 This script looks at every 500th occurance of a certain PC. If there are less than 500
occurances than the program will result in this error.
