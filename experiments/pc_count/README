This experiment contains two bash scripts.

RUNEXPER.SH-------- [Takes a name as an argument and the file to run (do not include .txt)]
    This script runs the asc system on the rsa file with the breakpoints in the
rsa_basic_loop_pcs.txt. This file contains the pcs in rsa that occur with the same
frequency as the program loops. This script will output a data file with the PC and
the maximum amount of excited bits that PC yields.


     The script also makes a plot from the data that was collected from the experiment. 
This will plot a histogram of PCs vs the excited bits that PC yields.


EXAMPLE RUN

./runexper.sh filename rsafilename

rsa files are assumed to be in the ubasicexper/experiments folder.
The naming convention is rsa* where * = the prime number.
