This experiment contains a bash script to run the experiment

---------RUNEXPER-------- 
Takes a filename (do not include .txt),the executable, the window_size, and the filetype as arguments (in that order)
    
    This script runs the asc system on the rsa file with the breakpoints in the
rsa_basic_loop_pcs.txt. This file contains the pcs in rsa that occur with the same
frequency as the program loops. This script will output a data file with the PC and
the maximum amount of excited bits that PC yields. The script also makes a plot from
the data that was collected from the experiment. This will plot a histogram of PCs vs
the excited bits that PC yields.


EXAMPLE RUN

./runexper filename executablename window_size type

rsa files are assumed to be in the ubasicexper/experiments/executables folder.
The asc folder is assumed to be immediately outside the /ubasicexper folder
The naming convention is rsa* where * = the prime number.
